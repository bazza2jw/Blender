These are the files to build a low cost camera motion controller.

The blend files are the designs of the parts. Different versions are included. These are better thought of as a set of guidelines and suggestions rather than a step wise build process.

The blend files may have several scenes with alternative designs.

The design uses:

Tubing. Recycled cheap gazebo or tent poles.
Stepper motors - NEMA 17 seem to work OK.
Arduino Uno pluc CNC sheild and stepper motor drivers
Timing belt, about 10m.
3D Printed parts. About 2kg of filiment may be needed. Most parts can be printed "course". The gears need to be printed "fine" resolution.
An ATX PSU (salvage from old PC)

Software

The Ardunio source CMController runs the camera motion controller. The PanTilt runs the servo based pan-tilt.

The software has a simple terminal interface.
