    INTRODUCTION

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   When making films, using virtual sets
                   combined with green screen footage is
                   fairly routine. We all like to put
                   ourselves in unusual settings.

                                   ME                               
                   The challenge when combining the
                   Computer Graphics  footage with the
                   live footage is getting the two
                   cameras, the CG scene camera and the
                   real camera to agree.

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   If the camera is fixed then the scene
                   geometry, in principle is known, and so
                   the two can be matched. If the camera
                   is moving then motion tracking can be
                   used to match a scene camera to the
                   real camera. This is a complex process
                   time consuming and or expensive process

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   However the CG scene camera always
                   knows exactly where it is and where it
                   is pointing. If the scene camera could
                   control the real camera then the two
                   cameras could be made to match
                   automatically, in principle.

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   This requires the use of a camera
                   motion controller (CMC) linked to the
                   CG scene camera. The CG and live
                   footage can be combined using, for
                   example, OBS studio to give a real time
                   draft quality result.

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   CMCs are available but they cost many
                   thousands of pounds/dollars/euros. The
                   question is, can a usefully working CMC
                   be made for say £100 rather than
                   £20,000?

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   The answer is yes. A CMC is very
                   similar in operation to a CNC machine.
                   The parts for CNC machines are readily
                   available and are inexpensive or even
                   free if you can find a unit to salvage.

                                   ME                               
                                   .                                
                   It is easy to write a Blender plugin to
                   control the CMC using the scene camera.

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   The design here uses the frame from a
                   salvaged gazebo the parts from a
                   salvaged 3D printer, plus about £100 of
                   other parts. Even if the all the parts
                   are bought new the cost should be under
                   £200.

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   3D printed parts are used. The design
                   files are in the Github repository,
                   link in the description. These designs
                   may have to be adapted. It will take
                   about a week to print all the parts.

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   This is not a complex project but does
                   need good knowledge of 3D printing and
                   basic electronics and software.

    THE BUILD

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   This is the built CMC. It is about 2m
                   square, with movement in the vertical
                   and horizontal as well as pan and tilt.

    CNC controllers operate the stepper motors. There is one CNC
    controller for the position and one CNC controller for the Pan-
    Tilt. The CNC controller is based on an Arduino

    I used cable ties to join parts together, simpler and avoids
    breaking the printed parts.

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   The 3D printed unions join the frame
                   together. The frame can be glued or
                   screwed together, depending on
                   requirements. If the unit will remain
                   in a studio then glueing may be best.
                   Or a combination of the two.

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   The timing belts must be correctly
                   tensioned. And the horizontal section
                   must be level.

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   The camera is moved up and down with
                   stepper motors at each end. The counter
                   weights must chosen to give an
                   effective zero weight to the horizontal
                   bar, plus camera.

    SUMMARY

                                   ME                               
                                   -                                
                   This is a simple low cost means to
                   simplify the use of virtual sets. This
                   rig acts as a programmable cameraman,
                   always ready and obeys instructions
                   exactly over and over again.
